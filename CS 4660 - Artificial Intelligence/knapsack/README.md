# Knapsack-problem
Various algorithms for solving the knapsack problem. Inspired by [Week 2](https://www.coursera.org/learn/discrete-optimization/home/week/2) of the Coursera [Discrete Optimization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/discrete-optimization/) course.

* __handout.pdf__. The handout for the knapsack homework.

* __solver.py__. A file that calls various solvers on various data sets.

* __bb_solver.py__. An implementation of the branch-and-bound solver discussed in the videos. Includes additional efficiency measures.

* __data__. A directory of datasets. ks_4_1 has been modified from ks_4_0; ks_6_0 has been added.
