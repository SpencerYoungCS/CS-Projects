# Knapsack-problem
Various algorithms for solving the knapsack problem. Inspired by [Week 2](https://www.coursera.org/learn/discrete-optimization/home/week/2) of the Coursera [Discrete Optimization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/discrete-optimization/) course.

* __handout.pdf__. The handout for the knapsack homework.

* __solver.py__. A file that calls various solvers on various data sets.

* __basic_solvers.py__. A dynamic programming solver and some greedy solvers.

* __bb_solver.py__. An implementation of the branch-and-bound solver discussed in the videos. Includes additional efficiency measures.

* __data__. A directory of datasets. One has been modified from the original (ks_4_1); one has been added (ks_6_0).
